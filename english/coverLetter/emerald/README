emerald is a package which  gives support for some free  ECF
(emerald  city  fontwerks,   http://www.speakeasy.org/~ecf/)
fonts  in  LaTeX.  These  fonts  are  mainly  display and/or
handwritten fonts.

The  distribution  includes the  Type1  fonts, all  required
files for  using them  within LaTeX  and font  map files for
dvips and pdfTeX. File "emerald.pdf" shows all these fonts.


Installing the files
--------------------
A  TDS-compliant  TeX system,  e.g.,  teTeX, fpTeX,  MikTeX,
emTeX/TDS, VTeX/Free is assumed. Target directories which do
not yet exist  are to be  created first. Copy  trees "fonts"
and "tex" into your texmf folder. 

 
Configuring dvips
-----------------
Make dvips  read the  additional font  map file emerald.map.
This is usually accomplished by adding the line

p +emerald.map

to the dvips configuration file. With teTeX, fpTeX or MikTeX
this   is   texmf/dvips/config/config.ps;   with   emTeX/TDS
additions should go to texmf\dvips\local\dvips.ini.

On MiKTeX you can instead add the line

Map emerald.map

to file  texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg and  the run  mkfntmap in  a
shell window. This will also configure pdfTeX and Yap.


Configuring pdfTeX
------------------
Make pdfTeX read the  additional font map file  emerald.map.
This is usually accomplished by adding the line

map +emerald.map

to  the  pdfTeX  configuration file.  With  teTeX,  fpTeX or
MikTeX this is texmf/pdftex/config/pdftex.cfg.

On MiKTeX you can instead add the line

Map emerald.map

to file  texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg and  the run  mkfntmap in  a
shell window. This will also configure dvips and Yap.


Updating the filename database
------------------------------
Certain TeX systems  require updating a  "filename database"
manually after adding  new files. Consult  the documentation
of your TeX system!


Using the emerald fonts with LaTeX
----------------------------------
load package emerald.sty (\usepackage{emerald}) which  gives
some   commands   to   switch  to   the   new   fonts.  Read
"doc/emerald.pdf" for details.


Legal notice
------------
The ECF  fonts are  freeware; but  see the  acompanying .TXT
files in folder "doc".
